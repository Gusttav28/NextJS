## Task Management System

Task Management System is a full-stack web application designed to manage and organize tasks efficiently. The backend was built with Django REST Framework (DRF) and MySQL, while the frontend was implemented with React and Next.js, providing a responsive, interactive, and scalable solution.

# 🚀 Project Purpose

The purpose of this project was to practice and strengthen skills in full-stack development, focusing on RESTful API design, frontend responsiveness, and system scalability. It also demonstrates end-to-end development, from database design and backend architecture to frontend implementation and documentation.
